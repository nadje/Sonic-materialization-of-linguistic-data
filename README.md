# Sonic-materialization-of-linguistic-data
The program allows the user to aggregate data from different hashtag [#] feeds on Twitter in real time. The data is being processed according to its linguistic features and in particular stress. The algorithm performs a series of tasks and extracts the stressed syllables of the aforementioned data. The output is a phonetic transcription code which represents each phoneme of the input Twitter feed. The encoded outputted list of data also includes suggestions for the sonic mapping based on the linguistic features of data and the soundâ€™s properties.
